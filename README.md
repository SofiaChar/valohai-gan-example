# GAN Training on Valohai

This project shows how to make a basic GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) training script work on Valohai. The original script comes from [Erik Linder-Nor√©n's PyTorch-GAN collection](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/blob/master/implementations/began/began.py), specifically the BEGAN model.

## What's This For?

The main purpose here is to help you understand what changes you need to make to a normal GAN training script to get it running on Valohai. Valohai is a platform that makes it easier to run, track, and manage your machine learning experiments.

## Changes Made

Here's what we changed in the original script to make it work with Valohai:

1. **valohai.yaml**: We added a file called `valohai.yaml`. This file tells Valohai how to run the script, including the environment, commands and parameters.

2. **Logging**: We changed the script so it sends updates to Valohai while it's running. This is done using a special print statement that outputs JSON.

3. **Saving Files**: The script saves pictures and models to a special folder called `/valohai/outputs`. This is how Valohai keeps track of the files your script creates.

## How to Run It

### Configure the repository:

To run your code on Valohai using the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Install Valohai on your machine by running the following command:
```bash
pip install valohai-cli valohai-utils
```

2. Log in to Valohai from the terminal using the command:
```bash
vh login
```

3. Create a project for your Valohai workflow. 

Start by creating a directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir valohai-gan-example
cd valohai-gan-example
```

4. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/valohai/gan-example.git .
```

5. Then, create the Valohai project and link it:
```bash
vh project create --name gan-test --link 
```



Congratulations! You have successfully cloned the repository, and you can now modify the code and run it using Valohai.

### Running Executions:

To run individual steps, execute the following command:
```bash
vh execution run <step-name> --adhoc
```

For example, to run the preprocess-dataset step, use the command:
```bash
vh execution run gan --adhoc
```

## Conclusion

This project makes it easy to run a GAN training script on Valohai. It's a nice way to use Valohai's tools for your machine learning projects without having to worry too much about the setup.
